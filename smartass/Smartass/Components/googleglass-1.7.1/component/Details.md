Design and develop for Glass with the GDK
=========================================

The GDK is an Android SDK add-on that contains APIs for Glass-specific features.

By using Xamarin, the Android SDK and GDK, you can leverage the vast array of Xamarin and Android APIs and also design a great experience for Glass.

Unlike the [Mirror API](https://developers.google.com/glass/develop/mirror/index), Glassware built with the GDK runs on Glass itself, allowing access to low-level hardware features.

The Glass platform is designed to make the existing Android SDK just work on Glass. This lets you code in a familiar environment, but for a uniquely novel device.

In addition, you can use all of the existing Android development tools like Xamarin, and your Glassware is even delivered as a standard Android package (APK).

So what are you waiting for?
