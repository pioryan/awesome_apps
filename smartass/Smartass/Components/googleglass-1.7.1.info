{"Name":"Glass Development Kit (Developer Preview)","Id":741,"Alias":"googleglass","Description":"Design and develop for Glass with the GDK\n=========================================\n\nThe GDK is an Android SDK add-on that contains APIs for Glass-specific features.\n\nBy using Xamarin, the Android SDK and GDK, you can leverage the vast array of Xamarin and Android APIs and also design a great experience for Glass.\n\n\n\nUnlike the [Mirror API](https://developers.google.com/glass/develop/mirror/index), Glassware built with the GDK runs on Glass itself, allowing access to low-level hardware features.\n\nThe Glass platform is designed to make the existing Android SDK just work on Glass. This lets you code in a familiar environment, but for a uniquely novel device.\n\nIn addition, you can use all of the existing Android development tools like Xamarin, and your Glassware is even delivered as a standard Android package (APK).\n\nSo what are you waiting for?\n\n\n\n**Glass is a trademark of Google Inc.**","Version":"1.7.1","Summary":"Build Glassware that runs directly on Glass XE17.","QuickStart":"You will need to be part of the Google Glassâ„¢ Explorer Program to run Google Glass applications, you can use [this form to sign up](http://www.google.com/glass/start/how-to-get-one/?source=xamarin).\n\nGetting Glass ready for development\n===================================\n1.
